# This is NOT your frontend cloned eCommerce project 
## A Backend-First, Production-Grade Full Stack Platform (In Progress)

**Java | Spring Boot | Spring Security | React | PostgreSQL | AWS**

This repository represents a **backend-focused, real-world eCommerce platform** that is being built step-by-step with a strong emphasis on **architecture, security, scalability, and real production practices**.

This is **not a UI clone** and **not a demo CRUD app**.  
The goal of this project is to understand and implement how a **real eCommerce system works internally**, starting from the backend and expanding outward.

## 🧠 Project Vision

Most eCommerce projects look similar on the UI side — product cards, cart, checkout.  
This project deliberately **does not focus on UI novelty**.

Instead, it focuses on:
- how authentication & authorization actually work
- how product systems are designed
- how APIs are secured and scaled
- how real backend systems evolve over time

The frontend exists to **consume real APIs**, not to mask weak backend logic.

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

- Backend-first development
- Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- DTO-based API design
- Security before features
- Incremental, production-style development
- Real database modeling (not mock data)

This project mimics how **enterprise systems are built iteratively**, not in one shot.
